We did a competitive study of Speech Emotion Detection. 
Emotion is a medium of expression of one’s perspective or one’s mental state to 
others. we are able to detect the mood of any person by just seating with him/her 
even if we don’t know him/ her first time by simply analysing the frequency of 
the tone of a particular person. To build a model to recognize emotion from 
speech using the librosa and sklearn libraries and the RAVDESS, TESS and 
CREMA-D datasets. SER aims to recognize the underlying emotional state of a 
speaker from her voice. The primary objective of SER is to improve man-machine 
interface. It can also be used to monitor the psycho physiological state of a person 
in lie detectors. In recent time, speech emotion recognition also finds its 
applications in medicine and forensics.
